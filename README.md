User Interface

There are three main controls:

    Home - Stops the current process and returns you to the menu from almost anywhere in SHARK

    Next - Moves the cursor to the next menu option. In function modes, this usually stops the process and returns you to the previous menu.

    Select - Activates the currently-selected menu option, and wakes up the dimmed screen in function modes

NEMO Portal

In NEMO Portal mode, NEMO activates an open WiFi Hotspot named "Nemo Free WiFi" (configurable in portal.h) with DNS, DHCP and Web servers activated.

    NEMO Portal serves a fake login page that claims to provide internet access if you log in.
    This is a social engineering attack, and will log the username and passwords entered on the page.
    From the Wifi Scan details, you can clone an existing SSID from the scan list. Exiting NEMO Portal will clear the Evil Twin SSID
    You can view captured credentials by connecting to the portal from your own device and browsing to http://172.0.0.1/creds
    You can set a custom SSID by connecting to the portal from your own device and browsing to http://172.0.0.1/ssid
    If your device supports EEPROM for settings, the custom SSID you enter will be saved as the default, even if powered off.
    If your device has an SD Card reader with a FAT filesystem formatted card inserted, the usernames and passwords will be logged to nemo-portal-creds.txt on the SD Card for you to peruse later.
    SD Card support is only enabled by default on the M5Stack Cardputer platform. It can be enabled on M5Stick devices but an SD Card reader must be built and attached to the front panel pin header.
    NEMO Portal is only for use on professional engagements with a valid scope of work, educational or demonstration purposes. Storage, sale, or use of personal information without consent is against the law. ðŸ¤“
